## Welcome

This is what you can expect for your OnRamp week.  The organizers have put together a great program for you with the goal of giving you a jump start on your IT career. The content will be a mix of traditional presentations, demonstrations, and hands-on exercises led by veteran IT professionals.

This program is a "conference-within-a-conference." Your schedule also includes attending keynotes and major events in the main conference. You are invited and encouraged to attend all evening social events that are part of the primary conference. These events are what makes this conference special. Breaks are scheduled to coincide with the main conference so you will have plenty of opportunities to mingle and network.

## Attendance

It is expected that you will attend all OnRamp sessions.
You are __not__ permitted to jump back and forth between OnRamp and main conference sessions.

## Course Material

We will be using the OnRamp Slack channel for communications.
If you have questions or comments that you don't feel comfortable asking during the day, please use this channel.
The main conference Slack channels are also great ways to network with other attendees.
Presentation material, including slides and sample code will be available on Github at [https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/OnRamp-2024](https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/OnRamp-2024).
You don't need a Github account to access the site.
You will able able to download a zip file of all content from the site.
Content will be added throughout the week. Final content should be available within a week of the end of the program.

## Your Hosts

The OnRamp program has been developed with you in mind. The content is designed for beginning IT professionals who want a jump start on their IT career, with an emphasis in automation and Devops. Guest speakers will present some material based on their expertise.

### Jeff Hicks

Jeff Hicks is one of the "old guard" of the PowerShell world.
He is one of the early Microsoft PowerShell MVPs, a well-known author, conference speaker, and teacher. When he isn't writing PowerShell-related books or creating courseware for Pluralsight, you can find him walking the dog, doing a crossword puzzle and enjoying a nice glass of wine, bourbon or scotch.
Although, probably not all at the same time! You can discover more about Jeff, including where to find him on social media at [https://jdhitsolutions.github.io/](https://jdhitsolutions.github.io/).

### Mike F. Robbins

Mike F. Robbins, a former Microsoft MVP, is the lead technical writer for Azure PowerShell at Microsoft. With extensive experience in PowerShell, he is a scripting, automation, and efficiency expert. As a lifelong learner, Mike continuously strives to improve his skills and empower others by sharing his knowledge and experience. Mike is also a published author, and when he's not writing documentation for Microsoft, he can be found sharing his thoughts and insights on his blog at [mikefrobbins.com](https://mikefrobbins.com/).

## Agenda

Your agenda will consist of live presentations, pre-recorded content, open discussion, and hands-on exercises. This scheduled is always subject to change.

Breaks are scheduled to coincide with the [PowerShell Summit].
Not all presentations have to be formal lectures with PowerPoint.
Some sessions may be nothing more than a conversation with attendees.
