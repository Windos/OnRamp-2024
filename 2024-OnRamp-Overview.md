# OnRamp 2024 Overview

The DevOps Collective's OnRamp program returns for another year with a revamped focus and direction. This unique program is targeted to the new or up-and-coming IT professional looking to get a jump start on automation, DevOps, and cloud technologies and learn more about what a career as an IT professional looks like today. The content will mix traditional presentations, demonstrations, and hands-on exercises led by veteran IT professionals.

OnRamp attendees will enjoy a blend of content from the PowerShell Summit conference track and the OnRamp program. Conference and OnRamp attendees must adhere to their ticketed event. Due to the nature of the OnRamp agenda, jumping between events is not allowed.

## Agenda

OnRamp attendees will have their own agenda that should include these topics:

- An introduction to PowerShell and PowerShell automation
- An introduction to the world of DevOps
- An introduction to cloud technologies
- Containers and Kubernetes
- Infrastructure as code
- Test Driven Development
- IT Career Skills
- Source control with Git and GitHub

This is not a complete outline; some content is subject to change.
